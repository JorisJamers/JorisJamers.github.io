# Gameboy Pocket 

This gameboy pocket was in a decent shape but I decided to install a fresh new case and new buttons. I also inserted a new backlit screen to upgrade the gameboy for a better gaming experience. 

Whilest the gameboy was opened I also did a thorough internal cleaning of the components.
