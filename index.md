# About Me

Started at [Gluo NV](http://www.gluo.be) as a DevOps Engineer on 1 August 2019. During my studies at [University College PXL](https://www.pxl.be)
I got obsessed with Linux and automation. Having these interests, the perfect company to launch my carreer was [Gluo NV](http://www.gluo.be), where I'm still having a lot of
fun.

Currently I am working as a Container Orchestration Engineer consultant
at [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com).  

Most of my free time I spend on playing table tennis, mountainbiking and hiking. I'm also a huge travel enthusiast.  

# Hobby projects 
## [Kubetools](pages/projects/kubetools.md)
Some cool little maintenance tools for Kubernetes.

## Gameboy Refurbishing 

In my spare time I also refurbish and mod gameboys. This can be anything, 
from reshelling the gameboy or upgrade it with a new screen. Succesfully modded / 
refurbished the following models : 

* [GBP](pages/hobbyprojects/gbp.md)
* GBC 
* GBA
