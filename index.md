# About Me

Started at [Gluo NV](http://www.gluo.be) as a DevOps Engineer on the 1st of
August 2019. During my studies at [University College PXL](https://www.pxl.be)
I got obsessed with Linux and Automation. Having these obsessions, [Gluo NV](http://www.gluo.be)
was the perfect company to start my IT carreer. And I am still having a lot of
fun at [Gluo NV](http://www.gluo.be).

Currently I am working as a Container Orchestration Engineer consultant
at [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com).
